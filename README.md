# Under Pressure 1

**Under Pressure 1** is a C# application developed for Loccioni by We+ to manage testing machinery for low-pressure petrol injectors. The software allows operators to control test cycles, monitor injector performance in real time, and log results for analysis and diagnostics.

It includes a graphical interface for machine control, communication with sensors or hardware controllers, and optional export of test data. The system is intended for industrial use in quality control and R&D environments.
